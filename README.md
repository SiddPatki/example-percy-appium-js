# example-percy-appium-js
Example app used by the [Percy Js Appium tutorial](https://docs.percy.io/docs/js-appium-testing-tutorial) demonstrating App Percy's Python Appium integration.

## JS Appium Tutorial

The tutorial assumes you're already familiar with javascript and
[Appium](https://appium.io/) [wd](https://github.com/admc/wd)/[webdriverio](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio) framework and focuses on using it with Percy. You'll still
be able to follow along if you're not familiar with JS Appium, but we won't spend time introducing Python Appium concepts.


The tutorial also assumes you have [Node 14+ with
npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and
[git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed.

Depending on which package you use for testing please follow tutorial in either `wd` directory or `webdriverio` directory.
