Example app used by the [Percy JS Appium tutorial](https://docs.percy.io/v2-app/docs/appium-for-javascript) and [Percy JS WebdriverIO tutorial](https://docs.percy.io/v2-app/docs/webdriverio-for-javascript) demonstrating App Percy's JS Appium and WebdriverIO integrations.

## JS Appium Tutorial

The tutorial assumes you're already familiar with JavaScript and the [Appium](https://appium.io/) [wd](https://github.com/admc/wd)/[webdriverio](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio) framework. You'll still
be able to follow along if you're not familiar with Appium concepts, but we won't spend time introducing JS Appium concepts.


This tutorial also assumes you have [Node 14+ with npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and
[git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed.

Depending on which framework you use for testing, please follow the tutorial in either `wd` directory or `webdriverio` directory.
